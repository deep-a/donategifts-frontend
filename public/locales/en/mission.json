And with your help, we collectively send holiday and birthday gifts to foster children and homeless youth. Our verified partner agencies create and manage wish cards for the kids under their care. Each wish card is unique and personal and linked with the gift item they want to receive. Donation is directly linked to the product sold on Amazon, and after your confirmed payment, we ship the gift to each managing foster agency. The agency staffs or social workers collect and distribute the delivered items to each kid."
