              No minor or non-certified caregiver can register as a foster care partner to create wish cards on their
              own, in order to prevent any potential misuse of our site.

              Once you are verified as a foster care partner, you can manage the account and create wish cards for the
              children under your care. You may not have immediate permission to create the wish cards until your
              account is reviewed and verified.

              If you are a foster care parent or an agency staff, please use your work email to sign up. We will send a
              verification link to your work email (email address that is associated with your organization).
